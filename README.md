# Math Exercises

Exercises from various textbooks, all in Coq. Using this both as a chance to
learn Coq, and to learn advanced mathematics. The textbooks I'm using, and
solving from are:

* `aata` = [Abstract Algebra: Theory and Application](http://abstract.ups.edu/)
* `homotopy` = [Homotopy Type Theory](https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/)
